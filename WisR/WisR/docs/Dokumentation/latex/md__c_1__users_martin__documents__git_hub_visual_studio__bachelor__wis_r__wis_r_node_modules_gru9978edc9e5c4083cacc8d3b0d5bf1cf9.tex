node-\/asn1 is a library for encoding and decoding A\+S\+N.\+1 datatypes in pure J\+S. Currently B\+E\+R encoding is supported; at some point I\textquotesingle{}ll likely have to do D\+E\+R.

\subsection*{Usage}

Mostly, if you\textquotesingle{}re {\itshape actually} needing to read and write A\+S\+N.\+1, you probably don\textquotesingle{}t need this readme to explain what and why. If you have no idea what A\+S\+N.\+1 is, see this\+: \href{ftp://ftp.rsa.com/pub/pkcs/ascii/layman.asc}{\tt ftp\+://ftp.\+rsa.\+com/pub/pkcs/ascii/layman.\+asc}

The source is pretty much self-\/explanatory, and has read/write methods for the common types out there.

\subsubsection*{Decoding}

The following reads an A\+S\+N.\+1 sequence with a boolean. \begin{DoxyVerb}var Ber = require('asn1').Ber;

var reader = new Ber.Reader(new Buffer([0x30, 0x03, 0x01, 0x01, 0xff]));

reader.readSequence();
console.log('Sequence len: ' + reader.length);
if (reader.peek() === Ber.Boolean)
  console.log(reader.readBoolean());
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Encoding}

The following generates the same payload as above. \begin{DoxyVerb}var Ber = require('asn1').Ber;

var writer = new Ber.Writer();

writer.startSequence();
writer.writeBoolean(true);
writer.endSequence();

console.log(writer.buffer);
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Installation}

\begin{DoxyVerb}npm install asn1
\end{DoxyVerb}
