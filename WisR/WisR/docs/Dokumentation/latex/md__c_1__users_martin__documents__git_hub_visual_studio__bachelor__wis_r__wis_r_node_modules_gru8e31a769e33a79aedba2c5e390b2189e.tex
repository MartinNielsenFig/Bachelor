\subsection*{Development}

\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+Jasmine Core Maintainers Only\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+

Follow the instructions in {\ttfamily C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+I\+B\+U\+T\+I\+N\+G.\+md} during development.

\subsubsection*{Git Rules}

Please work on feature branches.

Please attempt to keep commits to {\ttfamily master} small, but cohesive. If a feature is contained in a bunch of small commits (e.\+g., it has several wip commits or small work), please squash them when merging back to {\ttfamily master}.

\subsubsection*{Version}

We attempt to stick to \href{http://semver.org/}{\tt Semantic Versioning}. Most of the time, development should be against a new minor version -\/ fixing bugs and adding new features that are backwards compatible.

The current version lives in the file {\ttfamily /package.json}. This version will be the version number that is currently released. When releasing a new version, update {\ttfamily package.\+json} and {\ttfamily bower.\+json} with the new version and {\ttfamily grunt build\+:copy\+Version\+To\+Gem} to update the gem version number.

This version is used by both {\ttfamily jasmine.\+js} and the {\ttfamily jasmine-\/core} Ruby gem.

Note that Jasmine should only use the \char`\"{}patch\char`\"{} version number in the following cases\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes related to packaging for a specific platform (npm, gem, or pip).
\item Fixes for regressions.
\end{DoxyItemize}

When jasmine-\/core revs its major or minor version, the binding libraries should also rev to that version.

\subsection*{Release}

When ready to release -\/ specs are all green and the stories are done\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Update the release notes in {\ttfamily release\+\_\+notes} -\/ use the Anchorman gem to generate the markdown file and edit accordingly
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Update the version in {\ttfamily package.\+json} to a release candidate
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Update any links or top-\/level landing page for the Github Pages
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsubsection*{Build standalone distribution}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Build the standalone distribution with {\ttfamily grunt build\+Standalone\+Dist}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsubsection*{Release the Python egg}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily python setup.\+py register sdist upload} You will need pypi credentials to upload the egg.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsubsection*{Release the Ruby gem}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Copy version to the Ruby gem with {\ttfamily grunt build\+:copy\+Version\+To\+Gem}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries N\+O\+T\+E}\+: You will likely need to point to a local jasmine gem in order to run tests locally. {\itshape Do not} push this version of the Gemfile.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries N\+O\+T\+E}\+: You will likely need to push a new jasmine gem with a dependent version right after this release.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Push these changes to Git\+Hub and verify that this S\+H\+A is green
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily rake release} -\/ tags the repo with the version, builds the {\ttfamily jasmine-\/core} gem, pushes the gem to Rubygems.\+org. In order to release you will have to ensure you have rubygems creds locally.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsubsection*{Release the N\+P\+M}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily npm adduser} to save your credentials locally
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily npm publish .} to publish what\textquotesingle{}s in {\ttfamily package.\+json}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsubsection*{Release the docs}

Probably only need to do this when releasing a minor version, and not a patch version.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily cp -\/\+R edge \$\{version\}} to copy the current edge docs to the new version
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Add a link to the new version in {\ttfamily index.\+html}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsubsection*{Finally}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Visit the \href{https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases}{\tt Releases page for Jasmine}, find the tag just pushed.
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Paste in a link to the correct release notes for this release. The link should reference the blob and tag correctly, and the markdown file for the notes.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item If it is a pre-\/release, mark it as such.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Attach the standalone zipfile
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

There should be a post to Pivotal Labs blog and a tweet to that link.
